# RestAssured - Wearable Patient Monitoring Device
Project repo for IDEAHack16

Bedsores (pressure ulcers) can be fatal if left unattended and require constant attention from a medical professional. But since it is difficult for one nurse to manage multiple patients, we created a smart shirt that detects pressure and updates doctors and nurses about multiple patients in real-time through our companion iOS app. We designed this with the hope that both patients and medical professionals can feel safe and rest assured.
