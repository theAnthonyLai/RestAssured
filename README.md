# RestAssured - Wearable Patient Monitoring Device

Project repo for IDEA Hacks 2016

Bedsores (pressure ulcers) can be fatal if left unattended and require constant attention from a medical professional. But since it is difficult for one nurse to manage multiple patients, we created a smart shirt that detects pressure and updates doctors and nurses about multiple patients in real-time through our companion iOS app. We designed this with the hope that both patients and medical professionals can feel safe and rest assured.

### Companion App's Screenshots
Connecting to Parse server, our companion iOS app updates patient's real-time status to doctors and nurses. When a particular pressure sensor detects excess amount of pressure for a set amount of time, it immediately updates the data on Parse. Our iOS companion app will then alert medical professionals with a blinking red light on the pressured part of the patient's body.
